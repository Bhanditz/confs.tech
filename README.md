Confs.tech is an open source project that lists upcoming tech conferences. Everything is free and will stay free. It's aimed to be simple and without useless clutter. You can filter by topics and [see upcoming CFPs](https://confs.tech/cfp).

## Adding a conference

All conferences are stored in [JSON files](https://github.com/tech-conferences/conference-data/tree/master/conferences), sorted by topics and years. All data is open source and crowd sourced by the community. Whether added directly [from the website](https://confs.tech/conferences/new) by conference organizers or through pull requests.

Conference data have the following structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "",
    "url": "",
    "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "city": "",
    "country": "",
    "cfpUrl": "",
    "cfpEndDate": "",
    "twitter": ""
  }
```

If you want to contribute, the project is React based (it's an ejected create-react-app), so running:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Should do the trick!
